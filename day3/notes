#objective: classify credit card transactions

### THE ORIGINAL DATA IS IMBALANCED
### SMOTE from imblearn


# Notes

    # 1) PCA (dimensionality reduction)
    # 2) we can't the original data for great results.
            # train the model on synthetically enhanced dataset
            # test the model on original values
    # 3) we can use hyperopt to try different models or hyperparameters values for one algorithm!








Sequence


1)Loading the original
2)Preprocessing : scaling one column & reducing dimensions
[   features, target  ]<----------original dataset

3) TO check model's performance on imbalanced data (original data)
        -dtree_model, logit_model, svc_model
        [Can we improve f1-score if I use SMOTE?]

4) create oversample dataset using imblean library
        [X_sm, y_sm]<------------enhanced dataset(where synthetic points were added to fraud category [minority class lablled 1])
        [X, Y]<-------------original features & target

5) Train the model on the enhanced dataset [X_sm, y_sm]

6) Test the model on the original dataset [X & Y] 


*step 5 & 6 can be clubbed into a function with logic being repeated for multiple models

7) HYPEROPT TUNING !!!!!!!!

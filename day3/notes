### THE ORIGINAL DATA IS IMBALANCED
### SMOTE from imblearn


# Notes

    # 1) PCA (dimensionality reduction)
    # 2) we can't the original data for great results.
            # train the model on synthetically enhanced dataset
            # test the model on original values
    # 3) we can use hyperopt to try different models or hyperparameters values for one algorithm!

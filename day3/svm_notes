Explaination of effects of hyperparameters


i) KERNEL : linear[point, line, plane] or non-linear[poly,rbf]

        If data shows clear separation linearly for available features,
        use linear kernel OTHER WISE use non-linear kernel

        *Note: rbf should be default and don't switch kernels unless the effect of polynomial is determined

ii) gamma : forces data to be fitted more if gamma value is high
            *high values of gamma can cause overfitting!!!



        ## High degree leads to more training times

iv) C : HOW SIGNIFICANTLY WOULD WE PENALIZE THE MODEL IF IT MAKES A MISTAKE DURING TRAINING?
        With increasing C, chances of overfitting increases!






Objective: Identify the best algorithm along with correct hyperparameters to detect fraudulent transactions

    - Continue with imblearn examples
    - What f1 score for the did you find with hyperopt??
    - arrangement of code should be focussed on
